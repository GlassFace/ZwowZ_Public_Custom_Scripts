This is a project I came up with as a concept. I got the idea from playing MOBA type games a lot :p. I may work on it in the future but I do not know. I figure I should share the script so new people can maybe improve or remake it better.

Good luck.

Note- You must create your own creatures. This is a small project I came up with over a weekend It is not very finished and only has basic functionality currently.

How to use- Include the script into your core and set the world locations in the script to new ones you would like to use or keep them the same. You must create your own NPCS & your own game object spawns.


How the game works- The first player to queue is set as the game leader, the second player to queue becomes the second game leader. The first leader is teleported to the game start location where they are able to start the game and summon the second leader. Players are able to join in once the game has started. The teams have a max size of 3 players per team in an event at a time.
